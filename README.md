# ZUR Project Kick-Off

## Role: Junior Software Tester (Manual)

## Company: Mlota Testing Ltd

This was a **group project** done near the end of the Software Testing 12-week course at Niyo Bootcamps. 

## Project Details
We met a client called Zuri, a fashionista, who was struggling to manage her Boutique bookings and orders.

Having searched for the best software development team for her new website, she has decided to approach Mlota Testing Ltd to build her new website and we have accepted.

The SDLC model adopted for this project is the agile Kanban methodology.

Following several meetings with Zuri and her team, the product requirements and design has been defined and documented. The product owner assigned to Zuriâ€™s project was Rachel and she was our point of contact. She defined the software requirements and presented them as user stories. 

These requirements can be found in confluence. We were given login detail which cannot be disclosed for security reasons.

In addition to the testers in our team, the development team also includes 2 developers: Linzi and Mike. They received the same requirements as us and have begun coding already.

In this repository, you can check out the PowerPoint my group presented on our demo day as well as our test cases on each functionality. I also attached the test eveidence for one of the functionalities 'Proceed to Checkout' which was submitted top JIRA on the KANBAN board. The KANBAN board was accessible to everyone in the cohort, the product owner (Rachel) as well as the software developers.
